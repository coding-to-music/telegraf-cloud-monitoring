All this makes deployment and setup a breeze and easier to secure.

The InfluxDB Platform also includes APIs, tools, and an ecosystem that includes 10 client and server libraries, Telegraf plugins, visualization integrations with Grafana, Google Data Studio, and data sources integrations with Google Bigtable, BigQuery, and more.

Telegraf open source data collector
Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf is written in Go and compiles into a single binary with no external dependencies, and requires a very minimal memory footprint.

With 200+ plugins already written by subject matter experts on the data in the community, it is easy to start collecting metrics from your endpoints.

For additional architecture (e.g. i386, riscv64, etc.) and operating system (e.g BSD, etc.) downloads please see the Telegraf GitHub Releases page.
